I completed the pro mode.

##Index.html

Takes a form for the employee and has a table and total monthly cost.

##app.js

Uses jquery to append the dom with all the employees that it gets from the form. Uses that information to calculate the total monthly cost. Has a remove button that not only removes the employee information from the table but also removes the employees salary from the monthly cost.

##stylesheet.css

Stylizes the table and form.
